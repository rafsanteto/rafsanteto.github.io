The dataset was generated from a spectral bin microphysical scheme-based simulation of convective events near Darwin, Australia, during the monsoon period of the TWP-ICE field campaign, where the horizontal resolution was 1 km with varying vertical resolution and the outputs were saved every 10 minutes. To solve the dataset issue we applied threshold-based segmentations on the dataset and modified the outcome by an expert.
