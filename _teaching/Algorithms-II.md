## Objectives
After successful completion of this course, students should be able to:
* Argue the correctness of algorithms using inductive proofs and invariants. 
* Analyze worst-case running times of algorithms using asymptotic analysis. 
* Describe the advanced divide-and-conquer paradigm and explain when an algorithmic design situation calls for it. Derive and solve recurrences describing the performance of divide-and-conquer algorithms. 
* Describe the advanced dynamic-programming paradigm and explain when an algorithmic design situation calls for it and analyze them. 
* Explain the advanced graph algorithms and their analyses. Employ graphs to model engineering problems, when appropriate. 
* Compare between different data structures. Pick an appropriate data structure for a design situation.
