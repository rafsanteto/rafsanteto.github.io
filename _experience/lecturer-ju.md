**Courses and Laboratories**
* **Data Structures**
    * **Topics Covered:** Analysis and design of fundamental data structures including array-based lists, linked lists, stack, queue, hash table, recursion, binary tree, binary search trees(AVL tree, Red-Black tree), heaps, sorting(insertion, selection, bubble, merge sort, quick sort), searching (linear search, binary search)and basic graphs.
    * **Lab Outlines:** Design algorithmically efficient data structures for solving problems that provide a pathway towards competitive programming.
