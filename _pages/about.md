Greetings! I'm Md. Rafsan Jani, and I'm looking for a Ph.D position starting in Fall 2024. I am currently pursuing an MS in Advanced Computing at Morgan State University, which is fully funded. I am also working as a Graduate Research Assistant in the GESTAR division under the supervision of [**Dr. Xiaowen Li**](https://www.morgan.edu/climate-science/faculty-and-staff/xiaowen-li) in collaboration with [**Dr. Md Mahmudur Rahman**]( https://www.morgan.edu/computer-science/faculty-and-staff/md-rahman)â€™s [Computer Vision Lab](https://mdrahmanlab.com/) since Fall 2022.

In this position, I have been responsible for generating 3D Convective Cloud Updraft Cell Datasets and developing a deep learning model for 3D instance segmentation of the dataset. This work has allowed me to gain valuable experience in working with large datasets, implementing deep learning instance segmentation models, and analyzing complex visual data. Both the dataset and segmentation model papers have been accepted for oral presentation at the 23rd Conference on Artificial Intelligence for Environmental Science, scheduled for January 2024.

Some of the relevant coursework I have completed during my MS in Advanced Computing at Morgan State University includes Data Science and Artificial Intelligence, Deep Learning in the Cloud, Advanced Network Security, Cybersecurity and Quantum Computing. These courses have provided me with a strong foundation in the theoretical and practical aspects of machine learning in security and computer vision, which I believe will be invaluable in pursuing a Ph.D. in this field. I have also received the [**IBM Masters Fellowship Award**](https://research.ibm.com/university/awards/masters_fellowship_awardees.html#example2-tab2) and the Academic Trailblazer Award for my exceptional academic records.

Originally, I am from Bangladesh, and I completed my graduation from the Department of Computer Science and Engineering, Jahangirnagar University. Following my graduation, I joined the same department as a Lecturer and later on promoted to an [**Assistant Professor**](https://juniv.edu/teachers/rafsan). During my time at Jahangirnagar University, I taught undergraduate courses in computer science and engineering, including Introduction to Programming, Data Structures, and Algorithms. I was responsible for developing course materials, delivering lectures, and conducting lab sessions. I also mentored undergraduate students on their research projects and supervised their thesis work. This teaching experience has honed my communication skills and deepened my understanding of the subject matter. I have also received several academic honors for my outstanding performance and published several research papers in reputable journals. Currently, I am on study leave for pursing higher education.

My ultimate career goal is to become a leading researcher in the field of computer vision and security, working on cutting-edge technologies that have a significant impact on industries such as autonomous vehicles, environmental monitoring, healthcare, and robotics. I am passionate about pushing the boundaries of what is possible in computer vision and using my expertise to address real-world challenges.
