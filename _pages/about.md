Greetings! I am Md. Rafsan Jani, an aspiring PhD candidate. Currently, I am enrolled in the Master's program in Advanced Computing at Morgan State University, where I'm also working as a Graduate Research Assistant under the guidance of [Dr. Xiaowen Li](https://www.morgan.edu/climate-science/faculty-and-staff/xiaowen-li). In this role, my primary responsibility revolves around the application of deep learning techniques for the segmentation of 3D convective updraft cloud cells.

My academic journey began in Bangladesh, where I graduated from the Department of Computer Science and Engineering at Jahangirnagar University. Following my graduation, I transitioned into the role of a Lecturer at the same department, and I currently hold the position of an Assistant Professor. I am currently on a study leave as I embark on my pursuit of higher education.

In the grand scheme of things, my overarching objective is to propel my career in the field of machine learning. To achieve this, I am committed to continuous learning and skill development, with a specific focus on becoming a dependable researcher specializing in computer vision
