Greetings! I'm Md. Rafsan Jani, and I'm looking for a Ph.D. position starting in fall 2025. 

Currently, I am pursuing an MS in Advanced Computing at Morgan State University. I am also working as a Graduate Research Assistant in the GESTAR division under the supervision of [**Dr. Xiaowen Li**](https://www.morgan.edu/climate-science/faculty-and-staff/xiaowen-li) in collaboration with [**Dr. Md Mahmudur Rahman**]( https://www.morgan.edu/computer-science/faculty-and-staff/md-rahman)â€™s [Computer Vision Lab](https://mdrahmanlab.com/) since Fall 2022. In this position, I have been responsible for generating 3D Convective Cloud Updraft Cell datasets and developing a deep learning model for 3D instance segmentation. 

Originally, I am from Bangladesh, and I obtained B.Sc. and M.Sc. in Computer Science and Engineering at [**Jahangirnagar University**](https://www.juniv.edu). Following my graduation, I joined at Jahangirngar University as a _Lecturer_ and later earned a promotion to an [**Assistant Professor**](https://juniv.edu/teachers/rafsan). In these roles, I taught several courses, including Structured Programming Language, Object-Oriented Programming Language, Data Structures, Algorithms, Software Testing, etc. I was responsible for developing course materials, delivering lectures, and conducting lab sessions. I also mentored undergraduate students on their research projects and supervised their thesis work. I received several academic honors for my outstanding performance and published several research papers in reputable journals. Currently, I am on study leave to pursue higher education.

[//]: # (My ultimate career goal is to become a leading researcher in the field of computer vision, working on cutting-edge technologies that have a significant impact on industries such as autonomous vehicles, environmental monitoring, healthcare, and robotics. I am passionate about pushing the boundaries of what is possible in computer vision and using my expertise to address real-world challenges.)
