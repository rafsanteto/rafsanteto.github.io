## Objectives
After successful completion of this course, students should be able to:
* Understand and apply basic data structures for storage and retrieval of ordered and unordered data. 
* Implement and characterize algorithms for creation and manipulation of data structures like stacks, queues, linked list, etc. 
* Interpret and apply appropriate data structures for implementing problem solving algorithms such as searching, insertion, deletion, traversing mechanism, etc., on various data structures. 
* Compute and characterize the efficiency of data structures for complex problem-solving algorithms; perform and demonstrate this knowledge and write report for realistic problem solving.
